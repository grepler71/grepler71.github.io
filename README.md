This is a quick and easy way to call the authorizeCreditCard() function in the authorize-credit-card.php file from the authorize.net sample code. once you get this working you can add an if(ISSET(checkbox)) to call other Authorize.net sample code functions if you like. As I add more I'll add them here. 
<br />
To get this working you will need the Authorize.net SDK and sample code which can be found here: https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-php
